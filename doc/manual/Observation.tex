\subsection{\I{Observations} and likelihoods\label{sec:likelihoods}\index{Likelihoods}}

Observations are typically supplied as observations at an instance in time, over some spatially aggregated area. Time series of observations can be supplied as separate observations for each year or point in time. 

\SPM\ allows the following types of observations;

\begin{description}
  \item Observations of proportions by age class within categories
  \item Observations of proportions between categories within age classes
  \item Relative and absolute abundance/biomass observations
\end{description}

The definitions for each type of observation are described below, including how the observed values should be supplied, how \SPM\ calculates the expected values, and the likelihoods that are available for each type of observation.

\subsection{\I{Proportions-at-age observations}}

Proportions-at-age observations are observations of either the relative number of individuals at age or relative biomass at age. 

The observation is supplied for a given year and time step, for some selected age classes of the population (i.e., for a range of ages multiplied by a selectivity), for categories aggregated over a set of spatial cells. 

The age range must be ages defined in the partition (i.e., between \commandsub{model}{min\_age} and \commandsub{model}{max\_age} inclusive), but the upper end of the age range can optionally be a plus group --- which may or may not be the same as the plus group defined for the partition. 

Proportions-at-age observations can be supplied for a single category, aggregated across categories, or be proportions of multiple categories. For example, for a model with the two categories \emph{male} and \emph{female}, we might supply either (i) observations of the proportions of males (or alternately female) within each age class; (ii) proportions of total individuals (males $+$ females) at each age class, or (iii) the proportions of individuals for both male and female categories simultaneously. In addition, each category must have an associated selectivity, defined by \subcommand{selectivities}. 

The way the categories of the observation are defined specifies which of these alternatives to use. For example, to specify that the observations are of the proportions of male within each age class (example (i) above), then the subcommand \subcommand{categories} for the \commandlabsubarg{observation}{type}{proportion\_by\_age} command is,

\begin{verbatim}
categories male
\end{verbatim}

\SPM\ then expects that there will be a vector of proportions supplied, with one proportion for each age class within the defined age range. For example, if the age range was 3 to 10, then 8 proportions should be supplied (one proportion for each of the the ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The expected values will be the expected proportions of males within each of these age classes, after applying a selectivity at the year and time step specified. Note that the supplied vector of proportions (i.e., in this example, the 8 proportions) must sum to one (with a default tolerance of 0.001).

By default, categories are aggregated. For example, to specify that the observations are of the proportions of total individuals (males $+$ females) at each age class (example (ii) above), then the subcommand \subcommand{categories} is,

\begin{verbatim}
categories male female
\end{verbatim}

\SPM\ then expects that there will be a vector of proportions supplied, with one proportion for each age class within the defined age range. For example, if the age range was 3 to 10, then 8 proportions should be supplied. The expected values will be the expected proportions of selected males plus selected females within each of these age classes, at the year and time step specified. Note that the supplied vector of proportions (i.e., in this example, the 8 proportions) must sum to one (with a default tolerance of 0.001).

Otherwise, to provide proportions for multiple categories simultaneously, you need to spe3cify which categories are aggregated and which are separate. \SPM\ uses a $:$ symbol to denote those categories to are separate. For example, to specify that the observations are of the the proportions of individuals for both male and female simultaneously at each age class (example (iii) above), then the subcommand \subcommand{categories} is,

\begin{verbatim}
categories male : female
\end{verbatim}

\SPM\ then expects that there will be a vector of proportions supplied, with one proportion for each age class within the defined age range for males and then females. For example, if the age range was 3 to 10, then 16 proportions should be supplied, the first set of 8 corresponding to the proportions of male (out of male and female combined) and the second 8 to female. The expected values will be the expected proportions of selected males and selected females within each of these age classes, at the year and time step specified. Note that the supplied vector of proportions (i.e., in this example, the 16 proportions) must sum to one (with a default tolerance of 0.001).

The definition of categories can be a combination of the above cases and can become more complex as the number of categories in the model increases. For example, in a model with categories male-immature, male-mature, female-immature, and female-mature, we might supply observations of males (immature and mature combined) and females (immature and mature combined) simultaneously. Here the \subcommand{categories} subcommand would be;

\begin{verbatim}
categories male-immature male-mature : female-immature female-mature
\end{verbatim}

Assuming that we wanted to supply observations for ages 3 to 10, then \SPM\ would expect a vector of 16 proportions for each spatial location --- the first eight corresponding to the observed proportions of males aged 3--10, and the second set of eight corresponding to the proportions of females aged 3--10. Further, the proportions would sum to one.

The observations must be supplied using all or some of the the values of defined by a categorical layer. \SPM\ calculates the expected values by summing over the defined ages (via the age range and selectivity) and categories for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has the same value as defined for each vector of observations.

For example, in a $2 \times 2$ spatial model a categorical layer (e.g., with label Area) may define that cells $(1,1)$ and $(1,2)$ have value $A$ and cells $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$ have value $B$, i.e.,

\begin{verbatim}
@layer Area
type categorical
data A A 
data B B
\end{verbatim}

Here we supply observations for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has value $A$ as, 

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyProportions
...
categories male female
min_age 1
max_age 5
obs A 0.01 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.01 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.03
...
\end{verbatim}

Or, for both $A$ and $B$ as,

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyProportions
...
categories male female
min_age 1
max_age 5
obs A 0.01 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.01 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.03
obs B 0.02 0.06 0.10 0.21 0.18 0.02 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.01
...
\end{verbatim}

To supply an observation for individual spatial cells, then you will need to define a categorical layer with a single, unique value for each spatial cell. 

\SPM\ always evaluates the observations at the end of a time step (i.e., after \SPM\ has applied all of the processes for that time step). However, the observation can be applied to the abundance at the start of a time step or part-way through a time step by the use of the \subcommand{proportion\_time\_step} subcommand. Here \SPM\ stores the state of the partition at the beginning of a time step, and again at the end of the time step. The partition at some point $p$ during the time step is then evaluated as the weighted sum between the start and end of the time step, i.e, for any element $i$ in the partition, $n_i=(1-p) n_i^{start} + p n_i^{end}$.

\subsubsection{Likelihoods for proportions-at-age observations}

\SPM\ implements only one likelihood for proportions-at-age observations, the multinomial likelihood. 

For the observed proportions at age $O_i$ for age classes $i$, with sample size $N$, and the expected proportions at the same age classes $E_i$, the log-likelihood is defined as; 

\begin{equation}
  -\log \left(L \right) =  -\log \left(N! \right) + \sum\limits_i \log \left( \left(NO_i \right)! \right) - NO_i \log \left(Z \left(E_i,\delta \right) \right)
\end{equation}

where $\sum\limits_i O_i = 1$ and $\sum\limits_i E_i = 1$. $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is a robustifying function to prevent division by zero errors, with parameter $\delta>0$. $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is defined as,

\begin{equation}
   Z \left(\theta,\delta \right) = \begin{cases}
	  \theta, & \text{where $\theta \ge r$} \\
	  \delta/\left( 2-\theta/\delta \right), & \text{otherwise} \\  
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The default value of $\delta$ is $1 \times 10^{-11}$.

\subsection{Proportions-by-category}

Proportions-by-category observations are observations of either the relative number of individuals between categories within age classes, or relative biomass between categories within age classes. 

The observation is supplied for a given year and time step, for some selected age classes of the population (i.e., for a range of ages multiplied by a selectivity), for categories aggregated over a set of spatial cells. 

The age range must be ages defined in the partition (i.e., between \commandsub{model}{min\_age} and \commandsub{model}{max\_age} inclusive), but the upper end of the age range can optionally be a plus group --- which may or may not be the same as the plus group defined for the partition. 

Proportions-by-category observations can be supplied for any set of categories as a proportion of themselves and any set of additional categories. For example, for a model with the two categories \emph{male} and \emph{female}, we might supply observations of the proportions of males in the population at each age class. The subcommand \subcommand{categories} defines the categories for the numerator in the calculation of the proportion, and the subcommand \subcommand{categories2} supplies the additional categories to be used in the denominator of the calculation. In addition, each category must have an associated selectivity, defined by \subcommand{selectivities} for the numerator categories and \subcommand{selectivities2} for the additional categories used in the denominator, e.g., 

\begin{verbatim}
categories male
categories2 female
selectivities male-selectivity
selectivities2 female-selectivity
\end{verbatim}

defines that the proportion of males in each age class as a proportion of males $+$ females. \SPM\ then expects that there will be a vector of proportions supplied, with one proportion for each age class within the defined age range, i.e., if the age range was 3 to 10, then 8 proportions should be supplied (one proportion for each of the the ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The expected values will be the expected proportions of male to male $+$ female within each of these age classes, after applying the selectivities at the year and time step specified. 

The observations must be supplied using all or some of the the values of defined by a categorical layer. \SPM\ calculates the expected values by summing over the defined ages (via the age range and selectivity) and categories for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has the same value as defined for each vector of observations.

For example, in a $2 \times 2$ spatial model a categorical layer (e.g., with label Area) may define that cells $(1,1)$ and $(1,2)$ have value $A$ and cells $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$ have value $B$, i.e.,

\begin{verbatim}
@layer Area
type categorical
data A A 
data B B
\end{verbatim}

Here we supply observations for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has value $A$ as, 

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyProportions
...
categories male 
categories2 female
min_age 1
max_age 5
obs A 0.01 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.01 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.03
...
\end{verbatim}

Or, for both $A$ and $B$ as,

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyProportions
...
categories male
categories2 female
min_age 1
max_age 5
obs A 0.01 0.05 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.01 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.03
obs B 0.02 0.06 0.10 0.21 0.18 0.02 0.05 0.15 0.20 0.01
...
\end{verbatim}

To supply an observation for individual spatial cells, then you will need to define a categorical layer with a single, unique value for each spatial cell. 

\SPM\ always evaluates the observations at the end of a time step (i.e., after \SPM\ has applied all of the processes for that time step). However, the observation can be applied to the abundance at the start of a time step or part-way through a time step by the use of the \subcommand{proportion\_time\_step} subcommand. Here \SPM\ stores the state of the partition at the beginning of a time step, and again at the end of the time step. The partition at some point $p$ during the time step is then evaluated as the weighted sum between the start and end of the time step, i.e, for any element $i$ in the partition, $n_i=(1-p) n_i^{start} + p n_i^{end}$.

\subsubsection{Likelihoods for proportions-by-category observations}

\SPM\ implements only one likelihood for proportions-by-category observations, the binomial likelihood. 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    -\log \left(L \right)= -\sum\limits_i & \log \left(N_i! \right) - \log \left(\left(N_i \left(1 - O_i \right) \right)! \right) - \log \left(\left(N_i O_i \right)! \right) + N_i O_i \log \left(Z\left(E_i,\delta \right) \right) \\
    &+ N_i \left(1 - O_i \right)\log \left(Z\left(1 - E_i,\delta\right) \right)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

where $O_i$ are the observed proportions for age class $i$, $E_i$ are the expected proportions for age class $i$, and $N_i$ is the effective sample size for age class $i$. 

where $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is a robustifying function to prevent division by zero errors, with parameter $\delta>0$. $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is defined as,

\begin{equation}
   Z \left(\theta,\delta \right) = \begin{cases}
	  \theta, & \text{where $\theta \ge r$} \\
	  \delta/\left( 2-\theta/\delta \right), & \text{otherwise} \\  
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The default value of $\delta$ is $1 \times 10^{-11}$.

\subsection{Abundance}

Abundance observations are observations of either a relative or absolute number of individuals from a set of categories after applying a selectivity. 

The observation is supplied for a given year and time step, for some selected age classes of the population (i.e., for a range of ages multiplied by a selectivity), for categories aggregated over a set of spatial cells. Further, you need to provide the label of the catchability coefficient $q$, which can either be estimated of fixed. For absolute abundance observations, define a catchability where $q=1$.

Abundance observations can be supplied for any set of categories. For example, for a model with the two categories \emph{male} and \emph{female}, we might supply an observation of the total abundance (male $+$ female) or just male abundance. The subcommand \subcommand{categories} defines the categories used to aggregate the abundance. In addition, each category must have an associated selectivity, defined by \subcommand{selectivities}, e.g., 

\begin{verbatim}
categories male
selectivities male-selectivity
\end{verbatim}

defines an observation of the abundance of males. \SPM\ then expects that there will be a single abundance value supplied. The expected values will be the expected number of males, after applying the selectivities, at the year and time step specified. 

The observations must be supplied using all or some of the the values of defined by a categorical layer. \SPM\ calculates the expected values by summing over the defined ages (via the age range and selectivity) and categories for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has the same value as defined for each vector of observations.

For example, in a $2 \times 2$ spatial model a categorical layer (e.g., with label Area) may define that cells $(1,1)$ and $(1,2)$ have value $A$ and cells $(2,1)$ and $(2,2)$ have value $B$, i.e.,

\begin{verbatim}
@layer Area
type categorical
data A A 
data B B
\end{verbatim}

Here we supply observations for those spatial cells where the categorical layer has value $A$ as, 

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyAbundance
...
categories male 
obs A 1000
...
\end{verbatim}

Or, for both $A$ and $B$ as,

\begin{verbatim}
@observation MyProportions
...
categories male
obs A 1000
obs B 1200
...
\end{verbatim}

To supply an observation for individual spatial cells, then you will need to define a categorical layer with a single, unique value for each spatial cell. 

\SPM\ always evaluates the observations at the end of a time step (i.e., after \SPM\ has applied all of the processes for that time step). However, the observation can be applied to the abundance at the start of a time step or part-way through a time step by the use of the \subcommand{proportion\_time\_step} subcommand. Here \SPM\ stores the state of the partition at the beginning of a time step, and again at the end of the time step. The partition at some point $p$ during the time step is then evaluated as the weighted sum between the start and end of the time step, i.e, for any element $i$ in the partition, $n_i=(1-p) n_i^{start} + p n_i^{end}$.

\subsubsection{Likelihoods for abundance observations}

The lognormal likelihood with observations $O_i$, c.v. $c_i$, and expected values $qE_i$, and was,

\begin{equation}
 - \log \left(L \right) = \sum\limits_i \left( \log \left( \sigma _i \right) + 0.5\left( \frac{\log \left(O_i / q Z \left(E_i,\delta \right) \right)}{\sigma_i} + 0.5 \sigma_i \right)^2 \right)
\end{equation}

where 

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_i  = \sqrt{\log \left(1+c_i^2 \right)}
\end{equation}

and $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is a robustifying function to prevent division by zero errors, with parameter $\delta>0$. $Z \left(\theta,\delta \right)$ is defined as,

\begin{equation}
   Z \left(\theta,\delta \right) = \begin{cases}
	  \theta, & \text{where $\theta \ge r$} \\
	  \delta/\left( 2-\theta/\delta \right), & \text{otherwise} \\  
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The default value of $\delta$ is $1 \times 10^{-11}$.

\subsection{Process error}

Additional `process error' can be defined for each set of observations. Additional process error has the effect of increasing the observation error in the data, and hence of decreasing the relative weight given to the data in the fitting process. 

For observations where where the likelihood is parameterised by the c.v., you can specify the process error for a given set of observations as a c.v., in which case all the c.v.s $c_i$ are changed to

\begin{equation}
  c'_i  = \sqrt {c_i^2  + c_{process\_error}^2 } 
\end{equation}

Similarly, if the likelihood is parameterised by the standard deviation $sigma$,

\begin{equation}
  \sigma '_i  = \sqrt {\sigma _i^2  + \sigma _{process\_error}^2 } 
\end{equation}

or by the effective sample size $N$,

\begin{equation}
 N'_i  = \frac{1}{1 / {N_i}+ 1 / N_{process\_error}}
\end{equation}

In all three cases, the process error has more effect on small errors than on large ones. Be clear that a large value for the multinomial process error means a small process error.

\subsection{Simulating observations}

\SPM\ can generate simulated observations for a given model with given parameter values. Simulated observations are randomly distributed values, generated according to the error assumptions defined for each observation, around fits calculated from one or more sets of the 'true' parameter values. Simulating from a set of parameters can be used to generate observations from an operating model or as a form of parametric bootstrap. 

\SPM\ generates simulated observations for the observations defined in the \config\ with \commandlabsubarg{observation}{simulate}{True}. 

First, the model is run using the `true' parameter values, and a set of fits is produced for each set of observations. If a set of observations uses ageing error, then ageing error is applied to the fits as usual. If there are relative observations, then the catchability coefficient $q$ is applied to the fits as per normal. 

Second, each set of observations is randomised, based on (i) the fitted values, (ii) the type of likelihood specified, and (iii) the variability parameters (e.g., \subcommand{error\_value} and \subcommand{process\_error}). 

Methods for generating the random error, and hence simulated values, depend on the specific likelihood of each observation. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{} Normal likelihood parameterised by c.v.: Let $E_{i}$ be the fitted value for observation $i$, and $c_i$ be the corresponding c.v. (adjusted by the process error if applicable). Each simulated observation value $S_i$ is generated as an independent normal deviate with mean $E_i$ and standard deviation $E_i c_i$.
  \item{} Normal likelihood parameterised by standard deviation: Let $E_i$ be the fitted value for observation $i$, and $s_i$ be the corresponding standard deviation (adjusted by the process error if applicable). Each simulated observation value $S_i$ is generated as an independent normal deviate with mean $E_i$ and standard deviation $s_i$.
  \item{} Log-normal likelihood: Let $E_i$ be the fitted value for observation $i$ and $c_i$ be the corresponding c.v. (adjusted by the process error if applicable). Each simulated observation value $S_i$ is generated as an independent lognormal deviate with mean and standard deviation (on the natural scale, not the log-scale) of $E_i$ and $E_i c_i$ respectively. The robustification parameter $\delta$ is ignored.
  \item{} Multinomial likelihood: Let $E_i$ be the fitted value for observation $i$, for $i$ between $1$ and $n$, and let $N$ be the sample size (rounded up to the next whole number, and adjusted by process error if applicable). The robustification parameter $\delta$ is ignored. Then, 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{} A sample of $N$ values from $1$ to $n$ is generated using the multinomial distribution, using sample probabilities proportional to the values of $E_i$.
    \item{} Each simulated observation value $S_i$ is calculated as the proportion of the $N$ sampled values equalling $i$
    \item{} The simulated observation values $S_i$ are then rescaled so that their sum is equal to $1$
  \end{enumerate}
\item{} Binomial likelihood: Let $E_i$ be the fitted value for observation $i$, for $i$ between $1$ and $n$, and $N_i$ the corresponding equivalent sample size (rounded up to the next whole number, and adjusted by the process error if applicable). The robustification parameter $\delta$ is ignored. Then, 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{} A sample of $N_i$ independent binary variates is generated, equalling $1$ with probability $E_i$ 
    \item{}	The simulated observation value $S_i$ is calculated as the sum of these binary variates divided by $N_i$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
   
\subsection{Pseudo-observations}

\SPM\ can generate expected values for observations where there is no observed value. These are called pseudo-observations, and can be use to either generate the expected values from \SPM\, or as `observations' to be simulated from when using \SPM\ as an operating model.

All of the observation types in \SPM\ can be used as pseudo-observations. The observation command is \command{pseudo-observation}, and the subcommands are then the same as for observations except that;

\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not provide observed values ---these are not required to generate expected values of to simulate observations. Note that if you do provide observed values, \SPM\ will ignore them.
  \item The subcommands \subcommand{likelihood}, \subcommand{error\_value} and \subcommand{process\_error} will be ignored when generating the expected values for the pseudo-observation. However, if simulating (\texttt{spm -s}) then the subcommands \subcommand{likelihood} and \subcommand{error\_value} are required. In this case, \SPM\ needs to know the likelihood and error value to simulate observations. In addition, if the subcommand \subcommand{process\_error} is supplied, \SPM\ will modify the the error value (\subcommand{error\_value}) as usual, before generating the simulated observation.
\end{itemize}

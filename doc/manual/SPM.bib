  abstract = {Gibbs sampling has enormous potential for analysing complex data sets.
	However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack
	of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all
	applications have involved writing one-off computer code in low or
	intermediate level languages such as C or FORTRAN. We describe some
	general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing
	Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The
	BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language
	for specifying complex models; second, an expert system for deciding
	appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler;
	third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform
	the sampling. S objects are used for data input and output. BUGS
	is written in modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

  abstract = {Bayesian approaches to stock assessment provide a means for the analyst
	to combine information for the stock for which an assessment is needed,
	information based on expert opinion and inferences for other species
	in a probabilistic framework. It is even possible to consider uncertainty
	about which model of the population dynamics is correct. This manual
	provides an overview of the application of Bayesian methods through
	a series of worked examples in EXCEL, provided on the four accompanying
	diskettes. The examples are based on biomass dynamics and stock-recruitment
	models, and focus on the use of assessments that form the basis for
	evaluating the consequences of alternative management actions.},

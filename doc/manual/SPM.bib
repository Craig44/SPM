	abstract = {A new heuristic approach for minimizing possibly nonlinear and non differentiable continuous space functions is presented. By means of an extensive testbed, which includes the De Jong functions, it will be demonstrated that the new method converges faster and with more certainty than Adaptive Simulated Annealing as well as the Annealed Nelder\&amp;Mead approach, both of which have a reputation for being very powerful. The new method requires few control variables, is robust, easy to use and lends...},

   Abstract = {Gibbs sampling has enormous potential for analysing complex data sets. However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all applications have involved writing one-off  computer code in low or intermediate level languages such as C or FORTRAN. We describe some general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language for specifying complex models; second, an expert system for deciding appropriate methods for  obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler; third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform the sampling. S objects are used for data input and output. BUGS is written in modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

   Abstract = {Bayesian approaches to stock assessment provide a means for the analyst to combine information for the stock for which an assessment is needed, information based on expert opinion and inferences for other species in a probabilistic framework. It is even possible to consider uncertainty about which model of the population dynamics is correct. This manual provides an overview of the application of Bayesian methods through a series of worked examples in EXCEL, provided on the four accompanying diskettes. The examples are based on biomass dynamics and stock-recruitment models, and focus on the use of assessments that form the basis for evaluating the consequences of alternative management actions.},

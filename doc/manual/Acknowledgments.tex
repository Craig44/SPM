\section{Acknowledgements\label{sec:acknowledgements}}

We thank Nokome Bently \href{http://www.trophia.co.nz}{(TROPHIA)} and Ian Ball \href{http://www.aad.gov.au}{(Australian Antarctic Division)} for their work that led to the ideas behind the development of the movement paradigm employed in this  program. Thanks also to Andy McKenzie, Dave Gilbert, and Murray Smith \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)}for their helpful discussions with the authors. The \SPM\ logo was designed by Erika Mackay \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)}. 

Much of the structure of \SPM, equations, and documentation in this manual draw heavily on similar components of the population model CASAL \citep{1388}. We thank the authors of CASAL for their permission to use their work as the basis for parts of \SPM\ and allow the use of some of the definitions, concepts, and documentation from CASAL in \SPM. 

The development of \SPM\ was funded by the New Zealand \href{http://www.fish.govt.nz}{Ministry of Fisheries}, the \href{http://www.frst.govt.nz}{Foundation for Research, Science and} Technology, and the \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{National Institute of Water \& Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA)}.

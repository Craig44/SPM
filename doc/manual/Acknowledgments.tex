We thank Nokome Bently \href{http://www.trophia.co.nz/}{(TROPHIA)} and Ian Ball \href{http://www.aad.gov.au/}{(Australian Antarctic Division)} for their work that led to the ideas behind the development of this program. Thanks also to Andy McKenzie, Dave Gilbert, and Murray Smith \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)}for their helpful discussions with the authors. 

Much of the structure of \SPM\ processes, equations, and documentation on this manual draw heavily on the structure, processes, equations and document text for the population model CASAL \citep{1388}. We thank the authors of CASAL for their permission to use their work as the basis for the development \SPM\ and the use of text from the CASAL manual in the manual for \SPM.

The development of \SPM\ was funded by the New Zealand \href{http://www.fish.govt.nz}{Ministry of Fisheries}, the \href{http://www.frst.govt.nz/}{Foundation for Research, Science and} Technology, and the \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{National Institute of Water \& Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA)}.

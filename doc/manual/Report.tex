\section{The report section\label{sec:report-section}}

The report section specifies the printouts and other outputs from the model. \SPM\ does not, in general, produce any output unless requested by a valid report. Reports can be defined that are  not valid, for example printing the partition for a year and/or time-step that does not exist --- although  all reports must conform to syntax requirements.

\SPM\ has the following reports;

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Print the map (i.e., row and column labels of each spatial cell) of the spatial structure
  \item Print the partition for a year and time step
  \item Print the partition at the end of an initialisation
  \item Print a summary of a process
  \item Print a derived quantity
  \item Print the estimated parameters in a vector format (suitable for use with \texttt{spm -i})
  \item Print a summary of the estimated parameters
  \item Print the objective function values
  \item Print the covariance matrix
  \item Print an observation values, fits, and residuals
  \item Print a layer
  \item Print a derived view via a categorical layer
  \item Print a selectivity's values
  \item Print the random number seed
  \item Print the weight-at-size using the size-weight relationship
\end{enumerate}

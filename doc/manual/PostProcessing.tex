\section{Post processing output using \R \label{sec:post-processing}}

The \R\ package \texttt{spm} contains a set of \R\ functions for reading \SPM\ output, and is available as a precompiled binary for Microsoft Windows (.zip file) or as a source package (.gz file) for Linux. To check the version number and date of the \texttt{spm} \R\ package (useful for checking that you have the most recent version), use the function \texttt{spm.version()}.

The \texttt{spm} \R\ package includes a range of extract and write functions to aid post-processing of \SPM\ \config s and output. The main extract functions are briefly described below. In addition, the package also has a number of undocumented helper functions, that could be useful for writing you own analysis functions. See the the \R\ help for more detail e.g., \texttt{help(spm)}

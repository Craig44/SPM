Readme.txt for Spatial Population Model (SPM)
============================================

About
=====

The Spatial Population Model (SPM) is a generalised spatially explicit
age-structured population dynamics and movement model.

SPM can model population dynamics and movement parameters for an age-
structured population using a range of observations, including tagging,
relative abundance, and age frequency data. SPM implements an age-
structured population within an arbitrary shaped spatial structure,
which can have user defined categories (e.g., immature, mature, male,
female, etc.), and age range. Movement can be modelled as either adjacent
cell movements or global movements based on covariates.

See the SPM User Manual for more information.

and modifies the system registry to,
(i)   add to the the SPM install directory to the systems PATH
(ii)  associate .spm icons with Notepad.exe
(iii) register the uninstall information required to uninstall SPM.
